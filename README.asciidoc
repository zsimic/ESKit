Useful additions to UIKit classes
=================================

v1.0, September 2009

This contains a few classes that I needed for my Currency Master project, they help with customizing a few UIKit objects and provide some functionality I missed.

If you use these classes in your project, I'd love to know about it :) Let me know: zoran@simicweb.com

Overview
--------
This set of classes allows notably to:

* Make gradient round-corner buttons with no pixmaps (much easier to localize, and port to retina displays)
* Custom keypad
* A navigation controller that makes it dead simple to optionally place ads on top/bottom of it
* A table view controller that allows to:
** Optionally show a nice textured background
** Have custom headers (with a custom font) without having to redefine all the UITableView's delegate *header* routines
* A simplified UIWebView that allows to easily point to localized wikipedia articles
* A simple way to blend/emphasize UIColor objects or create them with their RGBA components (and several more named colors)
* A simple way to add a texture on the UINavigationBar

Non UI facilities (all in esmiler.h)

* A way to easily have localized text using a 'tr(str, ...)' macro instead of the much more verbose 'NSLocalizedString(key,comment)' approach
* A way to easily write assertions that are taken away at release
* A few macros that make it simpler to work with formatted strings

How to add this to your project
-------------------------------
If you're using git, simply add this as a submodule to your project:

--------------------------------------
cd <your project dir>
git submodule add git@github.com:zsimic/ESKit.git
--------------------------------------

If not, simply put a copy somewhere of these files, and a reference to them (or the subset you need) in your Xcode project.
